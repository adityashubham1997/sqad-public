## � Why SQAD-Public?

### The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful, but without structure they hallucinate, forget context between sessions, skip tests, ignore your team's conventions, and produce inconsistent results. You end up spending more time reviewing AI output than you saved.

### The Solution

SQAD-Public gives your AI assistant **structure, memory, and expertise** through 16 specialized agents that each bring a different professional lens to your work:

```
You:       "Implement the login story"
SQAD:      6 agents activate across 6 phases:
           → Nova analyses requirements and catches AC gaps
           → Atlas assesses architecture impact
           → Forge writes code matching your existing patterns
           → Cipher generates tests following your test framework
           → Raven + Aegis review for bugs and security issues
           → You approve at every phase before proceeding
```

### What Makes It Different

| Feature | Without SQAD | With SQAD |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | Hours of prompt engineering | `npx sqad-public init` — 5 seconds |
| **Stack awareness** | Manual context every session | Auto-detected once, always available |
| **Code style** | Generic, inconsistent | Matches your existing patterns |
| **Security** | Hope for the best | Aegis reviews every change against OWASP Top 10 |
| **Test coverage** | Often skipped | Cipher enforces TDD with your test framework |
| **Hallucination** | Frequent | Grounding Waterfall: code → KG → docs → ask |
| **AI control** | Full autonomy | User gates between every phase |
| **Dependencies** | Unknown supply chain | **Zero** — only Node.js built-ins |

### One Command, Any Stack

```bash
npx sqad-public init
```

That's it. SQAD detects your languages, frameworks, cloud, CI/CD, tracker, and IDEs automatically. No YAML to write. No plugins to install. No API keys needed. Works with **10+ languages**, **30+ frameworks**, **7 IDEs**, and **5 trackers** out of the box.

---

## � Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- An AI-powered IDE (Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.)

### One-line install (shell)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityashubham1997/sqad-public/main/install.sh | bash
```

With IDE options:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityashubham1997/sqad-public/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --ide claude,windsurf
```

The installer requires only **git + Node.js >= 18** (no npm/npx needed). It clones the repo to `~/.sqad-public`, pulls latest on every run, and runs init directly. Use `--update` to update an existing installation.

### Install via npx

```bash
npx sqad-public init
```

This will:
1. Copy the `sqad-method/` directory into your workspace
2. Auto-detect your tech stack (languages, frameworks, build tools, test frameworks)
3. Auto-detect cloud infrastructure (providers, IaC, containers, CI/CD, monitoring)
4. Auto-detect your issue tracker
5. Detect installed IDEs
6. Generate `config.yaml` with all detected values
7. Create output directories for specs, reviews, and releases

### Install with specific IDEs

```bash
# Specify which IDEs to configure
npx sqad-public init --ide claude,windsurf,cursor

# Configure all 7 supported IDEs
npx sqad-public init --ide all
```

### Global install (optional)

```bash
npm install -g sqad-public
sqad-public init
```

### Update an existing installation

```bash
npx sqad-public update
```

### Uninstall

```bash
npx sqad-public uninstall
```

```

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Security is a first-class concern. SQAD-Public is designed to be **safe to install in any codebase**, including enterprise and regulated environments.

### Zero Dependencies

```json
"dependencies": {}
```

SQAD-Public has **literally zero npm dependencies**. The entire framework uses only Node.js built-in modules (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`, `node:child_process`). This means:

- **Zero supply chain risk** — no transitive dependency vulnerabilities
- **No `node_modules/` bloat** — the package is 144 KB
- **No network calls** — detection is purely filesystem-based
- **Nothing phones home** — no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking pixels

### No API Keys Required

SQAD-Public does **not** require any API keys, tokens, or external service credentials to function. It works entirely within your local filesystem. Your AI IDE's existing authentication handles the LLM communication — SQAD only provides structure and context.

### What SQAD Reads

During `init`, the detection engines **read-only scan** your workspace for:

| What | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`, etc. | Detect languages and frameworks | Reads dependency names (not values) |
| `*.tf`, `Dockerfile`, `*.yaml` | Detect cloud infrastructure | Checks file existence and certain keywords |
| `.github/`, `.jira.yml`, env var names | Detect CI/CD and trackers | Checks existence only |
| `.xcodeproj`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, `*.csproj` | Detect mobile/desktop platforms | Deep scan up to 4 levels |

**SQAD never reads your source code during init.** It only checks for marker files and dependency lists.

### What SQAD Writes

| Location | Content | Editable? |
|---|---|---|
| `sqad-method/config.yaml` | Detected stack, cloud, tracker | ✅ Yes — your config |
| `sqad-method/agents/` | Agent definition files (read-only context for AI) | ⚠️ Preserved on update |
| `sqad-method/output/` | Specs, reviews, releases, tracking log | ✅ Yours — gitignored |
| `.claude/`, `.windsurf/`, `.cursor/` | IDE-specific skill files | ✅ Auto-generated per IDE |

### Built-in Safety Guards

Every agent follows `safety-guards.md` which enforces:

- **File scope protection** — Agents never modify files outside the current task
- **No auto-push** — Agents never push to remote without your explicit approval
- **Sensitive file detection** — Auto-generated files (lock files, build output, IDE config) trigger a warning before modification
- **Secret scanning** — Before any commit, agents scan for API keys, AWS access keys, private keys, connection strings, and `.env` files
- **Destructive action guard** — Delete, drop, truncate, and force push require explicit confirmation one at a time

### User Gates (Human-in-the-Loop)

Every multi-phase skill pauses between phases for your review:

```
Phase 1: ANALYSE → Nova + Atlas deliver analysis
         ⏸️ USER GATE: "Review analysis. Approve to continue?"

Phase 2: SPEC → Forge writes spec
         ⏸️ USER GATE: "Review spec. Approve to continue?"

Phase 3: IMPLEMENT → Forge writes code
         ⏸️ USER GATE: "Review code. Approve to continue?"
         ...
```

**Agents never proceed without your approval.** You can reject, modify, or redirect at any gate.

### Anti-Hallucination Protocol (Grounding Waterfall)

Agents follow a strict evidence hierarchy before making any claim:

```
1. Search codebase (grep, AST, file reads)
2. Query Knowledge Graph (if available)
3. Check documentation and artifacts
4. If nothing found → STOP and ASK the user
   ❌ Never fabricate file paths, function names, or API endpoints
```

### Compliance Ready

If your project has compliance requirements, set them in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
project:
  compliance: [soc2, hipaa, pci-dss, gdpr]
```

Aegis (Security Analyst) will automatically include compliance-specific checks in every review.

## 🔄 How It Works

SQAD-Public operates through a pipeline that transforms your workspace context into agent-powered workflows:

```
┌──────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  /setup  │ →  │  Detection  │ →  │  Config    │ →  │  Fragment  │ →  │  Agent +    │
│  (CLI)   │    │  Engines    │    │  Generate  │    │  Loading   │    │  Skill Run  │
└──────────┘    └─────────────┘    └────────────┘    └────────────┘    └─────────────┘
                 stack.js                              Stack-specific     Multi-agent
                 cloud.js           config.yaml        rubrics &          phase-gated
                 tracker.js         CONTEXT.md         patterns           workflows
```

### Core Concepts

- **Agents** — 16 specialized AI personas, each with a unique review lens, communication style, and domain expertise
- **Skills** — 27 phase-gated workflows (slash commands) that orchestrate multiple agents through a task
- **Fragments** — Modular knowledge units (stack patterns, cloud best practices, review rubrics) loaded dynamically based on your detected stack
- **Grounding Waterfall** — Anti-hallucination protocol: agents search code → KG → docs → artifacts before acting. If nothing found, they **stop and ask**
- **User Gates** — Every multi-phase skill pauses between phases for your review. Agents never proceed without your approval

`javascript` · `react` · `react-native` · `angular` · `vue` · `svelte` · `nextjs` · `express` · `nestjs` · `android` · `ios` · `ionic` · `csharp` · `dotnet-core` · `spring` · `django` · `flask` · `fastapi` · `rails` · `generative-ai`

Each stack fragment includes:
- **Core patterns** table (preferred vs avoid)
- **Project structure** reference
- **Code examples** with idiomatic patterns
- **Performance rules**
- **Security considerations**
- **Testing patterns**
- **Anti-patterns to flag**

### Cloud Fragments (8)

`aws` · `azure` · `gcp` · `docker` · `kubernetes` · `terraform` · `monitoring` · `github-actions`

### How Fragment Loading Works

```
1. Detection engines scan workspace → detect [react, typescript, aws, docker]
2. Fragment loader reads each fragment's YAML frontmatter:
   load_when: "stack.frameworks includes react"
3. Matching fragments are injected into the agent's context
4. Agent reviews code using stack-specific patterns + rubric checks
```

## ✅ Review Rubrics

Rubrics are review checklists loaded dynamically per detected technology. Each check has a severity level (CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, NIT).

### Available Rubric Modules (25)

| Category | Rubrics | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Always loaded** | `base`, `security` | Core quality + security baseline |
| **Languages** | `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `java`, `go`, `rust`, `ruby`, `csharp` | Language-specific anti-patterns |
| **Frontend** | `react`, `react-native`, `angular` | Component patterns, state management |
| **Mobile** | `android` (8 checks), `ios` (8 checks), `ionic` (7 checks) | Platform-specific safety |
| **Backend** | `spring` (7 checks) | Framework-specific patterns |
| **Cloud** | `cloud-aws`, `cloud-azure`, `cloud-gcp`, `kubernetes`, `docker`, `terraform` | Cloud security, IaC checks |
| **AI** | `generative-ai` (10 checks) | LLM safety, prompt injection, eval coverage |
| **Infrastructure** | `zero-trust-infra` | Least privilege, network segmentation |

### Example: Generative AI Rubric

| ID | Check | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| GAI-1 | Exposed API key — LLM key hardcoded or committed | CRITICAL |
| GAI-2 | No prompt injection defense — user input unsanitized | CRITICAL |
| GAI-3 | No LLM observability — calls without tracing | MAJOR |
| GAI-4 | No evaluation pipeline — AI feature shipped untested | MAJOR |
| GAI-5 | Hardcoded prompts — no versioning or template management | MAJOR |

### Example: Android Rubric

| ID | Check | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| AND-1 | Main thread I/O — synchronous network/disk (ANR risk) | CRITICAL |
| AND-2 | GlobalScope usage — leak risk from unscoped coroutines | CRITICAL |
| AND-4 | Missing `android:exported` — API 31+ crash | MAJOR |

## 📊 Knowledge Graph

SQAD-Public includes a built-in dependency graph builder that maps your entire codebase structure. Agents use this for impact analysis, blast radius estimation, and test coverage mapping.

### Build a Knowledge Graph

```bash
node sqad-method/tools/knowledge-graph/build.js .
```

**Output:**
```
📊 Building knowledge graph for: /path/to/your/project
   Found 31 source files
   Nodes: 31 | Edges: 26
   Source: 21 | Tests: 10
   God nodes: 0
   Output: knowledge-graph-out/graph.json
```

### View Summary

```bash
node sqad-method/tools/knowledge-graph/summary.js .
```

Shows god nodes (files with degree > 30 — high coupling risk), untested source files, and directory communities.

### Supported Languages

The KG builder scans imports/requires across: **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Go**, **Rust**, **Java**, and **Ruby**.

### How Agents Use It

Skills like `/dev-task`, `/review-pr`, and `/refresh` query `graph.json` for:

- **Impact analysis** — "What depends on the file I'm changing?"
- **Blast radius** — "How far do changes ripple (2-hop)?"
- **Test coverage mapping** — "Which test files cover this module?"
- **God node warnings** — "Is this a high-coupling component requiring extra review?"

If no knowledge graph exists, agents gracefully fall back to grep-based analysis. The KG is a bonus, never a blocker.

### Cross-Repo Support

```bash
node sqad-method/tools/knowledge-graph/summary.js --root ./repo-a ./repo-b ./repo-c
```

Aggregates stats across multiple repositories for monorepo or multi-service architectures.

---

## 🧪 Testing

SQAD-Public includes a comprehensive test suite with unit tests and end-to-end validation:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
node --test test/detect-mobile-ai.test.js

# Run e2e detection validation (62 assertions across 12 stacks)
node test/e2e-setup-test.mjs

# Run e2e init validation (29 assertions)
node test/e2e-init-test.mjs
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Is SQAD-Public safe to install in my enterprise codebase?

**Yes.** Zero dependencies, no network calls, no telemetry, no API keys required. It only reads marker files (not source code) during init. Everything stays local. See [Security & Privacy](#-security--privacy) for full details.

### Does SQAD-Public send my code to external servers?

**No.** SQAD-Public is a local framework that provides structure to your AI IDE. The AI IDE itself handles LLM communication (Claude, GPT, etc.) — SQAD only provides agent definitions, skill workflows, and context files that your IDE reads locally.

### What if my stack isn't detected?

Detection is best-effort. You can always manually edit `sqad-method/config.yaml` to add languages, frameworks, or cloud providers the auto-detection missed. Agents will use whatever is in `config.yaml`.

### Can I use SQAD-Public without an AI IDE?

The agent and skill definitions are plain Markdown files. You can read them manually, reference them in any LLM chat, or paste them into ChatGPT/Claude web interfaces. The CLI and IDE integrations just make it seamless.

### How do I add support for a new language or framework?

1. Add detection markers in `lib/detect/stack.js`
2. Create a stack fragment in `sqad-method/fragments/stack/your-stack.md`
3. Create a rubric module in `sqad-method/fragments/rubric/your-stack.md`
4. Add tests and run `npm test`

### Will `sqad-public update` overwrite my config?

**No.** The update command backs up your `config.yaml`, updates agents/fragments/templates, then restores your config. Your custom agents, plugins, and output data are never touched.

### Can I use only specific agents or skills?

Yes. You don't have to use all 29 skills. Just run the slash commands you need. Agents activate per-skill — you won't be overwhelmed.

### What's the difference between SQAD-Public and other AI coding frameworks?

SQAD-Public is **agent-first** (16 specialized personas with distinct review lenses), **phase-gated** (user approval at every step), and **grounding-enforced** (anti-hallucination waterfall). Most alternatives are prompt libraries or single-agent wrappers. SQAD gives you a full engineering team that collaborates, disagrees, and presents evidence.
